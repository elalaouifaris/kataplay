# Kataplay
In this repo I test code katas with different iterations changing the 
solution design or language.
All solutions are to be developped in TDD mode as much as possible.

# On Kataplay:
Katas with at least one implementation on kataplay:
- Remove duplicates

# Backlog:
Katas interesting do to:
- Spiral numbers: Given a number n print a spiral with numbers from 1 to n, inside out or outside in.
- Score [MÃ¶lkky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6lkky) game:
  - Give a number of players and list of tupples.
  - Each tupple is represent the pins hit.
  - Return the score of each player
- Hangman:
  - [Core mode](https://www.codewars.com/kata/hangman-game)
  - Interactive: CLI version with interactive terminal interface
- Code a [2048 Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)): on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/2048)
