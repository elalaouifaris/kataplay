# Kataplay - Remove Duplicates:

In this repo I test simple code katas with different iterations changing the 
solution design or language.
All solutions are to be developped in TDD mode, with a target of improving quality.

# Instructions:

Define a function RemoveDuplicate(nlist) to
remove duplicate elements from list.

Here are some examples:

[] -> []

[1,2] -> [1,2]

[1,1,2,2,3,3] -> [1,2,3]
